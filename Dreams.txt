Woke around 9:30am on 7/8/20 after a 16-hour sleep session:

-Wesleyan attendee reunion competition. I see Brian, Ken, and others. I worry about my stuff getting stolen, including a Sega Master system which is better than a Genesis. I have no shirt at some point.
-Mad at Mom after snooping at my house.
-Sarah face when younger.
-Outside of Mom's house looked like Australia for a bit with craters.
-Walking around shopping store, seeing Anna and others. Anna with Nick. I overheard someone ask her about not letting Mitch know.
-Seeing Kristen. Me asking her for her number and a date on bus near the front. We were talking. Walking aroung where she works. I get chased by security. I frantically run through the woods.

-School bus ride with other bands and Red Audio to Concord for a big multi-band show. Sitting near front of bus. Neal, Jordan were there and had bands playing. A Jordan band member tells me Jordan was is mad at us for canceling a show with them before.
-We play show at a ballroom in Woodell residential hall at Concord. It doesn't go well. We have to leave before I can get all my stuff. I buy a bunch of gear, including a reverse headstock white Squire-like strat.
-I have to drive back to Concord the next day to try to get my stuff. I hope they are open.
-When I get there, I decide to see a movie. No trailers. The movie ends up being an Adam Sandler snuff-comedy called "African".  It is dark, scary, and vulgar. Nudity of girl from GoT.

-I'm at a touristy building complex in Nashville. Like Grand ol' Opry. We tour it. Dad there in beginning. Instrument workshops. I have years of experience with guitar, bass, and keys. I get with woman who playing fiddle. I get stopped by salesman trying to sell me a bass, but he has no wooden short-scale hollow Les Paul-like basses. Food court. I walk into a game area. I get excited about a air hockey-like game with plinko pins and a fuzzy spiky ball. I go to other games. Dutch sees me and greets me. He is there with a friend and his wife. Friend is going to perform at a big competition. Dutch plays at impromptu open-mic.
